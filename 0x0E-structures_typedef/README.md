PROJECT: 0x0E. C - Structures, typedef
Project By: Anateyi Joseph  
Course: ALX SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

This project covers structures and typedefs in C programming. Structures allow grouping related data into a single composite type. This allows encapsulating different pieces of data into an organized structure. For example, a `struct dog` can store a dog's name, age, and owner together. Typedefs allow creating alias names for existing types. This is useful for giving cleaner names to struct types like `dog_t` for `struct dog`. 

Key topics include:

- Declaring and defining structures with different member types
- Initializing struct variables and accessing members 
- Learning dot syntax for accessing members of a struct
- Typedef'ing a struct to create a new named type
- Dynamically allocating memory for new struct instances
- Properly handling null pointers and failures
- Freeing memory allocated for structs when no longer needed

This project provides hands-on experience working with these important concepts in C. The tasks cover declaring, accessing, allocating, and freeing structures to master these essential skills.
